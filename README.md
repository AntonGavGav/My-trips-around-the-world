# Homework application

Before checking this assignment i want you to notice that:

- The details of what the webpage should contain were poorly given by the previous teacher. That means that most of the time I had 
to improvise and guess bc there wasn't no way to contact the teacher
- That's my first time using react.js 
- The website is slow asf
- Website itself was not made for mobile devices
